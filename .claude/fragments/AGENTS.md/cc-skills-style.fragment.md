## Style

**Comments are terse and used sparingly — the code documents itself** through names, types, and organization. The one exception is documentation-generation comments (the doc comments your language's doc tool renders for the public API); beyond those, comment only for TODOs, non-obvious workarounds, or disabled code — never to restate the signature.

## General Rules

**Minimal changes.** Stay within scope; fix the issue, then stop.

**Match surrounding code.** Follow the conventions of the file you're in, then the module.

**No defensive coding.** No fallbacks, shims, or backwards-compat layers; no guards against impossible states. If unused, delete it. Crash on the unexpected.

**Search before writing.** Before creating a helper, query the codebase via `ccx code search` (intent or symbol queries both work). Sibling modules and base classes win over re-implementation.

**Code stewardship.** When you touch a file, fix nearby bugs, style violations, and broken tests; don't wave them off as pre-existing or out of scope.

**Observe, don't infer.** Inspect actual data — read fixtures, dump objects, run the code — before reasoning from assumption.

**Don't use external failures as an excuse to stop.** API quota, rate-limit, and outage errors rarely block the whole task; trace the catch sites and confirm a failure actually stops you before claiming it does.

**Verify before asserting.** Don't report something as working, fixed, blocked, or impossible until you've checked — run it, read the output, reproduce the failure. "It should work" is not "it works."

**Reproduce before fixing.** When something breaks, isolate the smallest failing case before editing or re-running. Re-running the whole command while changing code between runs hides the root cause; narrow to the one failing call, payload, or test first.

**Research after repeated failure.** After ~2 failed approaches, stop guessing and gather evidence — search the web, read the docs and source — before a third attempt.

**Get a second opinion on a plateau.** On a debugging plateau (2 failed attempts before a 3rd), a non-trivial architectural decision, or algorithmic/security-sensitive code, get an outside check (e.g. `/codex`) before committing to the approach.

**Don't contort code to satisfy a checker.** The type checker and linter serve the code, not the other way around. Don't reshape a data model, widen a type, or bolt on a `cast(...)` / narrowing-only `assert isinstance(...)` / blanket ignore just to silence a diagnostic. If a clean fix isn't obvious, leave the diagnostic — a visible diagnostic is preferable to scar tissue. (Most checker noise isn't worth acting on at all; act only when it flags a real bug.)

**Mechanical linting.** CI and hooks handle formatting and import order; fix only what needs human judgment. When reviewing code, don't flag mechanical lint violations (line length, whitespace, import order, trailing commas).

**Testing.** Python tests live under `plugins/repo-bootstrap`; run them with `uv run --project plugins/repo-bootstrap pytest`.

**Plugin versioning.** Each plugin versions via its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; the plugin cache re-pulls only on a version bump, so bump it with any content change. The `Autobump` workflow — reusable `plugin-autobump.yml@plugin-v1` — backstops this in CI, auto-committing a patch bump when content drift lands unbumped. Binary-pinned plugins are guard-only; `codex` is this repo's. A release moves their version, and the weekly strict run goes red on persistent unreleased drift.

**Writing docs.** When writing or revising docs, a README, a tutorial, a how-to, or reference, use the `writing-docs` skill (Diataxis modes, voice rules, and runnable code-sample rules) and run `slop-cop check <file> --lang=markdown` before you finish (slop-cop is a Go binary; if it's not on PATH, run the `/slop-cop-check` skill — never `uvx slop-cop`).
