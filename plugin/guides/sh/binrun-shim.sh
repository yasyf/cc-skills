# Locate the binrun runner and exec the {{binary}} descriptor.
#
# This renders to plugin scripts/install-binary.sh — the successor to the
# provision-a-symlink installer. bin/{{binary}} is a committed symlink to it, so
# hooks, MCP servers, and the CLI reach this script with the tool's own
# arguments. Its whole job is to find binrun — named in BINRUN_BIN, stamped at
# the pinned tag in ~/.daemonkit/bin, on PATH, or bootstrapped once from the
# pinned release — and hand off to "binrun <descriptor> $@", which
# resolves and execs the version-exact artifact the sidecar bin/{{binary}}.binrun
# descriptor pins. Every failure here exits 1: exit 2 is reserved for a real
# hook verdict, and the only other codes come from the exec'd artifact itself.
#
# bash, not sh: this runs once per hook invocation, and an endpoint-security agent
# that deep-inspects /bin/sh as a living-off-the-land interpreter can put seconds on
# every exec of it. The body is POSIX either way.
