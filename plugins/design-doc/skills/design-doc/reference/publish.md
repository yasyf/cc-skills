# Publishing the doc

The doc is a static folder; anything that serves files works. The default path is Cloudflare via `wrangler` (the CLI arm of [Cloudflare Drop](https://www.cloudflare.com/drop/); workflow per `cloudflare.com/drop/llms.txt`).

## Stage

Deploy only the files meant to ship, with the doc as the index:

```bash
mkdir -p dist
cp design-doc.html dist/index.html
cp registers.json qa-log.json NOTES.md design-doc.pdf dist/
```

Rerun `python3 build-pdf.py` first when the registers changed since the last build, so the PDF button serves the current doc. The folder must contain an `index.html`; the renderer fetches its JSON with relative paths, so the flat copy is the whole build.

## Deploy

Check auth first: `npm exec --yes wrangler@latest -- whoami`.

**Authenticated** (OAuth, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, or a global API key):

```bash
npm exec --yes wrangler@latest -- deploy dist --name <slug> --compatibility-date <today>
```

The output ends with the live `<name>.<account>.workers.dev` URL. Redeploying with the same `--name` updates the same URL.

**Unauthenticated** — add `--temporary`:

```bash
npm exec --yes wrangler@latest -- deploy dist --name <slug> --temporary --compatibility-date <today>
```

This returns two URLs: the live `workers.dev` URL and a **claim URL**. Hand both to the user immediately: the claim URL grants ownership of the temporary deployment, expires after 60 minutes, and is sensitive (whoever opens it owns the site).

## Verify

One lightweight check: load the live URL and confirm the title renders. A 404 right after deploying usually means the route hasn't propagated; wait briefly and retry before changing anything. Exhaustive per-asset probing after a confirmed load is noise.

Local serving stays the fallback for private docs: `python3 -m http.server 8641` in the project folder.
